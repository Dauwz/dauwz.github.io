<img class="champimg" src="http://th04.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2013/289/2/d/katarina_poster_art_by_artgerm-d6qohlw.jpg"/>
	<p class="champdetails">Driven by an intense killer instinct, Katarina uses her talents as an assassin for the glory of Noxus, and the
	continued elevation of her family. While her fervor drives her to ever-greater feats, it can sometimes lead her astray.<br>

From childhood, Katarina displayed a natural gift for combat. As the daughter of a prominent Noxian general, many
paths were open to her, but she rejected them all for the path of the blade. Rigorously trained by the finest
assassins in Noxus, her father the best among them, it was not long before Katarina demanded her first assignment
The task they gave her was aggravatingly simple: assassinate a low-ranking Demacian officer. As she set to her
work infiltrating the enemy camp, Katarina discovered an opportunity too tantalizing to pass by the arrival of a
Demacian General. Stalking him to his tent, she quietly dispatched his guards and slit his throat. Pleased with her
impressive kill, she disappeared into the night. Katarina's elation faded the next day when her original objective, the
Demacian officer, led his forces to ambush unprepared Noxian soldiers. Though the Noxians fought valiantly,
they suffered heavy casualties. Furious at her mistake, Katarina set off to complete her original task. Returning to
the camp, she spied her now heavily guarded target and realized a stealthy kill was no longer possible. Drawing her
blades, Katarina swore the officer would die, no matter the cost. She leapt into battle, unleashing a whirlwind
of steel. One by one blades flashed and guards fell, each strike bringing her one step closer to the officer.
A final thrown dagger restored her honor. Bloody and bruised, Katarina barely escaped the Demacian forces, and
returned to Noxus a changed woman. The scar she earned that night now serves as a constant reminder that she must
never let passion interfere with duty.</p>

<p class="champdetails"><strong>Trivia:</strong> Very first champ I played. Loved her ever since, despite all the nerfs/buffs that reworked her beyond recognition. Also, dat red hair<p>

<section><li class="champ"><center><h1> Ahri - The Nine-Tailed Fox </h1></center></li>
<img class="champimg" src="http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2014/121/5/a/ahri___league_of_legends__fanart__by_kelly_nantes-d7goynw.jpg"/>
	<p class="champdetails">Unlike other foxes that roamed the woods of southern Ionia, Ahri had always
	felt a strange connection to the magical world around her; a connection that was somehow incomplete.
	Deep inside, she felt the skin she had been born into was an ill fit for her and dreamt of one day
	becoming human. Her goal seemed forever out of reach, until she happened upon the wake of a human
	battle. It was a grisly scene, the land obscured by the forms of wounded and dying soldiers. 
	She felt drawn to one: a robed man encircled by a waning field of magic whose life was quickly 
	slipping away. She approached him and something deep inside of her triggered, reaching out to the 
	man in a way she couldn't understand. His life essence poured into her, carried on invisible strands 
	of magic. The sensation was intoxicating and overwhelming. As her reverie faded, she was delighted to 
	discover that she had changed. Her sleek white fur had receded and her body was long and lithe, the 
	shape of the humans who lay scattered about her.<br>

However, though she appeared human, she knew that in truth the transformation was incomplete. A 
cunning creature, she adapted herself to the customs of human society and used her profound gift 
of beauty to attract unsuspecting men. She could consume their life essences when they were under the 
spell of her seductive charms. Feeding on their desires brought her closer to her dream, but as she took
 more lives, a strange sense of regret began to well within her. She had reservations about actions which
 never troubled her as a fox. She realized that she could not overcome the pangs of her evolving morality.
 In search of a solution, Ahri found the Institute of War, home of the most gifted mages on Runeterra.
 They offered her a chance to attain her humanity without further harm through service in the League of 
 Legends. </p>

<p class="champdetails"><strong>Trivia:</strong> You'd have to either not know Naruto or be an idiot not to realize the reference.
 I literally bought her the same day she came out, and really wasn't disappointed. And, c'mon, she's a goddamn sexually deviant fox-girl. What's not to like?<p>

<section><li class="champ"><center><h1> Akali - The Fist of Shadow </h1></center></li>
<img class="champimg" src="http://th09.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2012/114/c/8/lol_akali_by_beanbean1988-d4xelsu.jpg"/>
	<p class="champdetails">There exists an ancient order originating in the Ionian Isles dedicated 
	to the preservation of balance. Order, chaos, light, darkness―all things must exist in perfect 
	harmony for such is the way of the universe. This order is known as the Kinkou and it employs a 
	triumvirate of shadow warriors to uphold its causes in the world. Akali is one of these shadow 
	warriors, entrusted with the sacred duty of Pruning the Tree - eliminating those 
	who threaten the equilibrium of Valoran.<br>

A prodigious martial artist, Akali began training with her mother as soon as she could make a fist. 
Her mother's discipline was relentless and unforgiving, but predicated on the fundamental 
principle: "We do that which must be done." When the Kinkou inducted her into the order at the age 
of fourteen, she could slice a dangling chain with a chop of her hand. There was no question ― she 
would succeed her mother as the Fist of Shadow. She has had to do much in this role which others 
might find morally questionable, but to her it is in service of her mother's inviolable doctrine. 
She now works with her fellows ShenSquare.png Shen and KennenSquare.png Kennen to enforce 
the balance of Valoran. This hallowed pursuit has unsurprisingly led the triumvirate to the Fields of Justice.</p>

<p class="champdetails"><strong>Trivia:</strong> I somehow never got into playing her in the very beginning. Never knew how to properly use her.
When I <i>did</i> learn, however, I was doing at least four pentas per game.</p>

<section><li class="champ"><center><h1> Jinx - The Loose Cannon </h1></center></li>
<img class="champimg" src="http://th04.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2014/230/0/3/jinx_animation_by_sonellion-d7vo9xt.jpg"/>
	<p class="champdetails">Jinx lives to wreak havoc without a thought for consequence, leaving a trail of mayhem and panic in her wake. A manic and impulsive 
	criminal, she despises nothing more than boredom, and gleefully unleashes her own volatile brand of pandemonium to the one place she finds dullest: Piltover. 
	With an arsenal of deadly toys, she unleashes the brightest explosions and loudest blasts - all the better to shock and surprise the hapless authorities. 
	Always just out of the law's reach, Jinx's favorite game is to toy with Piltover's finest - especially Vi.<br>

Piltover had long been known as the City of Progress, a place where peace and order reigned. That serenity 
was challenged when a new kind of criminal arrived, the likes of whom had never been seen. This mysterious 
outlaw unleashed a series of warped and destructive capers that endangered the entire city, and left its people 
reeling from the worst crime spree in Piltover's history.<br>

As the string of crimes without rhyme or reason hit the city, sightings of the lawbreaker emerged. Though 
the young woman's origins were a mystery, some saw traces of Piltover hextech in her firearms, while others 
described the street fashions of Zaun in her dress. Because her arrival always brought trouble with it, 
those who crossed her path soon gave her a name: Jinx.</p>

<p class="champdetails"><strong>Trivia:</strong> She was released during the time I had quit League. When I came back and bought her... oh my GOD
that freaking Minigun attack speed and passive. I fell in love. And, well, she's made after Harley Quinn (y'know, from the Batman universe, duh), so, yeah.</p>

<section><li class="champ"><center><h1> Miss Fortune - The Bounty Hunter </h1></center></li>
<img class="champimg" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/364/b/2/sp__mafia_miss_fortune_by_cirath-d5pqz1c.jpg"/>
	<p class="champdetails">For those who brave the harsh seas of Runeterra, attaining one's own ship and crew is the pinnacle of success. Sarah Fortune, a well-respected 
	(some would say legendary) bounty hunter from Bilgewater, was able to achieve this feat just after her sixteenth birthday, etching out her name as the go-to gal for 
	resolving special troubles. No bounty was too difficult or too dangerous for her feminine charm and her renowned use of her twin pistols, "Shock and Awe". Her success 
	gave her the means to legitimately purchase her own ship - with a little flirtatious haggling, of course. Things weren't always so fortunate for Miss Fortune, though. 
	When she was young, trade ships began to dot the horizon of her quiet home along the northern shores of Blue Flame Island's largest chunk. Trade routes brought piracy, 
	and the inhabitants soon found themselves caught in a frenzy of pillage.<br>

One day, young Sarah returned home to hear gunshots and screaming. Her front door was smashed open; inside, 
she saw her mother lying in a pool of blood. A sudden blow to her head made her collapse next to her slain 
mother. The last thing she could remember were her attacker's red eyes, as his face was blocked by a rogue's 
bandanna. Miss Fortune has a strong distrust for pirates and she finds herself constantly bickering with the 
infamous Gangplank (the only captain to resist her charms) over the direction of Bilgewater politics. 
Her two goals: to unite the people of Bilgewater, making them into a strong and independent society, and to 
find the pirate who killed her mother. To that end, she has entered the League of Legends as a champion, 
trading her skills for the wealth and influence that will help her accomplish both.</p> 
	
<p class="champdetails"><strong>Trivia:</strong> Was (and probably still is) my main ADC. Loved her since the day I bought her. 6300IP well spent. Also, DAT RED HAIR.</p>

<section><li class="champ"><center><h1> Ezreal - The Prodigal Explorer </h1></center></li>
<img class="champimg" src="http://i.imgur.com/7hIIB.jpg"/>
	<p class="champdetails">The intrepid young adventurer Ezreal has explored some of the most remote and abandoned locations on Runeterra. During an expedition to the
	buried ruins of ancient Shurima, he recovered an amulet of incredible mystical power. Likely constructed to be worn by one of the Ascended, the enormous talisman 
	nonetheless fit snugly upon his arm, amplifying his raw sorcerous skill to such an extent that he's gained the reputation of a hero, much to his embarrassment. <br>
	
<p class="champdetails"><strong>Trivia:</strong> Also one of the few champs I bought very early on. He's that one champ which I play when I'm lazy to do stuff. Just ult and wait.</p>
